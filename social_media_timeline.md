# Social Media Timeline

### Where is our social media presence?
1. **[Facebook Public Page](https://www.facebook.com/djangogirlsPDX/)**: We have a much lighter presence here. Generally we only share major updates on Facebook. *In order to post from it, your personal Facebook account must be an admin of the page.*
2. **Private Facebook Group**: We have a private Facebook group that we've traditionally invited all coaches and attendees to after workshops. It was meant to create a space for people to ask for help or share resources. It seems to be virtually unused and isn't really providing the   value we envisioned. We may want to revisit if we want to maintain it at all, but it does still exist as a place were we post workshop updates. *In order to post in it, your personal Facebook account must be in the group. In order to add people you must   be an admin.*
3. **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DjangoGirlsPDX)**: This is far and away our most active social media platform. The majority of this timeline is about what we need to share on Twitter. It's also a point of contact for people to get in touch with us. People may tweet  at us or DM us  with questions so keep an eye out for those. *In order to tweet from it you must have the username and password to log into the account directly.*

### What should we be posted when?
*This is meant to pair with the [sample timeline](https://github.com/djangogirlspdx/docs/blob/master/sample_timeline.md) so you may want to reference that for added context*

#### 2.5 months before the workshop
- *(optional)* A tweet announcing that we have a workshop coming up and encouraging people to watch for the date and details soon

#### 2 months before workshop
- When the website is open, announce the date for the next workshop and that applications will be opening soon ðŸŒ¸
    - Also update our Twitter bio to say when the next workshop is
- Announce when attendee applications open ðŸŒ¸
- Announce when coach applications open ðŸŒ¸
- Do semi-regular tweets to promote applications (about weekly)
- As we reach the end of the application window (two weeks, one week, a few days etc.) make tweets telling people that the deadline is coming
- Should we decide to extend the application deadline (this often happens) announce it

#### 1 month before the workshop
- Sponsor tweets!
    - Make sure we're getting out the number of tweets we promised each sponsor.
    - Make sure the tweets are spaced out. Don't blast people with sponsor tweets all at once. Take advantage of TweetDeck which allows you to schedule tweets
    - Remember that you will probably get at least one tweet per sponsor done at the workshop because of lightning talks
- Some tweets to get people excited about the workshop!

#### 3 weeks before the workshop
- Once we have all our coaches on the website we usually tweet a screenshot of their pictures and thank them for coaching
- More "looking forward to workshop" tweets
- More sponsor tweets

#### 1 week before the workshop
- Reminder of coaches meeting
    - Keep an eye on Twitter (and email) during this meeting in case someone is lost or has an issue getting to the meeting
- EVEN MORE sponsor tweets
- EVEN MORE "yay it's almost the workshop" tweets

#### Installation night and workshop
*Remember to be careful about tweeting out potentially sensitive information at the workshop! Be sure not to tweet pictures that include links to things we don't want people outside the workshop to have access to or pictures of people who have a "don't photograph me sticker". We want  to make sure everyone feels safe at the workshop. Also it's going to be a little hectic so be extra wary of typos or mistakes, ask another organizer to proofread if needed*
- A "looking forward to seeing everyone" tweet in the morning
- Tweets about each lightning talk, try to get a nice picture of the speaker presenting if you can
- A "good night see you tomorrow" tweet at the end of installation night
- General workshop happenings! We want to show off how fun our workshops are!
    - **Food!** Especially if we get nice looking desserts or something like that
    - **Decorations!!** If we have any cool decorations consider tweeting those and/or grabbing a picture of the whole workspace
    - **Swag**, if weâ€™re giving out mugs or stickers or whatever maybe tweet a picture of those
    - **Workshop milestones** like finishing installation night, making it halfway through the day, etc. Maybe snag an appropriate gif to go with the tweet
    - Consider scrolling through the tweets from past workshops beforehand to get ideas
- Retweet coaches and attendees tweeting about the workshop! Watch our mentions or people tweeting with hashtags like `#djangogirls` or `#djangogirlspdx`(but be careful not to retweet something from a different workshop!)
- If possible grab a group picture before people start to go home! People tend to take off early so don't wait until the end of the day
- A coach picture
- A "thanks everyone for the great workshop!" tweet


ðŸŒ¸ = post to Facebook in addition to Twitter
