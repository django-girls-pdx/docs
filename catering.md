# Catering

Catering is a really important part of our workshops. Providing our attendees with meals that meet their dietary needs allows them to focus on learning, rather than worrying about how to find and pay for food in a potentially unfamiliar neighborhood. We usually provide dinner on installation night, a simple breakfast on workshop day, lunch, and snacks.

In general, what we look for in catering companies is:
- Able to accomodate vegan and gluten free diets
- About $10 per person per meal
- Efficient and clear communication (if you've sent more than 5 emails something is probably terribly wrong)

Places who have catered for us in the past:
- **The Vegan Caterer** (http://thevegancaterer.com/), an awesome, delicious, professional caterer that is unfortunately often busy with wedding orders.
- **Chipotle** (https://www.chipotle.com/); they're cheap, easy to work with, and an attendee told us that she decided to apply because her friend who attended previously told her about the chipotle we ordered.
- **Nicholas Restaurant** (http://nicholasrestaurant.com/)
- **Back to Eden Bakery** (https://www.backtoedenbakery.com/); an all vegan and gluten free bakery, great simple + cheap option for breakfast.
- **La Bonita** (https://labonitapdx.com/); tasty mexican food, local and family owned, most of the options are vegan and gluten free
- **Sizzle Pie** (https://www.sizzlepie.com/); good pizza, extensive vegan options, gluten free crust
