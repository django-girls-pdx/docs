# Venues
Django Girls PDX has been hosted at many fine venues, many of which sadly do not exist anymore. :broken_heart:

What we look for in venues:
- Central location close to public transportation and parking
- Accessible bathrooms (as well as accessibility in general)
- Space for childcare
- Space for nursing
- Space for quiet time
- Space for a welcome + lightning talks
