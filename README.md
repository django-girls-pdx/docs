## Django Girls PDX Docs

### Who is Django Girls PDX?
Django Girls PDX is the Portland chapter of Django Girls, an international organization dedicated to teaching women how to program through one-day programming workshops. Our chapter was founded in early 2015 by [Lacey Williams](https://twitter.com/laceynwilliams) and [Kenneth Love](https://twitter.com/kennethlove). We are currently organized by [Hailee Kenney](https://twitter.com/HAIL_9000), [Juliana Arrighi](https://twitter.com/juleslearns), [Kassidy Douglas](https://twitter.com/kcmdouglas), and [Rachel Klein](https://twitter.com/rachelkleinpdx). In the past we've also been organized by [Brigette Eckert](https://twitter.com/Brigette_Eckert), [Nathaniel Smith](https://twitter.com/nate_smith), and [Terian Koscik](https://twitter.com/spinecone).

### Why document us?
Django Girls PDX has hosted 8 workshops, helping over 250 women and gender minorities learn how to program and introducing them to the Portland tech community. That's an amazing accomplishment! But it also means we can't organize just by searching through gmail anymore.

### How should we document?
Currently, all organizers have full admin privileges to add whatever comes to mind. Eventually we should probably introduce some kind of structure. Iteration! :tada:

### What isn't in here?
There is some private stuff we are leaving out of here and keeping in slack, gmail, and google drive. This includes any information about attendees, places we've contacted about sponsorship but never heard back from, non-public contact information, etc. In general try to avoid including anything about specific people that isn't already publicly available.
