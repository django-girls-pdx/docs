This is the contract for Django Girls PDX organizers that we all agreed to on 10/24/17! It’s intended to hold us all accountable so that we can do our best to respect the time and money of our attendees, coaches, sponsors, partner businesses, and our fellow organizers. By agreeing to these statements we are making a promise that we will keep all of these folks’ best interests at heart.

### Django Girls PDX is about:
- Being inclusive
- Integrity, not having conflicts of interest
- Holding events that emphasize fun, building community, and learning, in that order
- Celebrating women and non-binary people

Whenever we need to make tough decisions, we remember these principles and try to incorporate them as much as possible.

In addition to maintaining our principles, we agree to commit to the following expectations for organizing:
	
### Communication
- If you won’t be available for a day or more, just let everyone know
- Try to respond in a timely manner if pinged (e.g. within a day or so, even if your response is to say you’re too busy to take something on that day)

### Time
- 20 minutes a day (on average, there tends to be a little more as we get closer to the workshop date)
- If you’re taking care of something, do your best to complete it in a timely manner and if you can’t do it in the next day or so be sure to communicate that to the rest of the team
- Be aware of deadlines, some things absolutely have to be done on time (e.g. ordering swag)

### Quality of Work
- Mistakes happen! The important thing is noticing them, correcting them, and trying not to make the same one twice. Consider having someone who can double check your work for mistakes/typos
- Make sure any outward facing work aligns with the Django Girls ~*~brand~*~ (a style guide about this is on the way)
- Respect the folks we’re working with, if people have a positive experience with Django Girls they’ll probably help us out again in the future!
